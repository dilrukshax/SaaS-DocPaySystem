- Structured error responses
- Validation error mapping
- Custom validation rules

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- Performance monitoring middleware
- Comprehensive health checks (database, service bus, storage, memory)
- Metrics collection and tracking
- Request/response monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

### Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server (LocalDB or full instance)
- Azure Service Bus (or RabbitMQ alternative)
- Stripe account for payment processing
- SendGrid account for email notifications

### Configuration
1. **Database Setup**: Update connection strings in `appsettings.json` for each service
2. **Service Bus**: Configure Azure Service Bus connection strings
3. **Stripe**: Add Stripe API keys for payment processing
4. **SendGrid**: Configure SendGrid API key for email notifications
5. **JWT**: Update JWT secret key (must be at least 32 characters)

### Running the Services

Each service can be run independently:

```bash
# User Service
cd services/UserService/UserService.API
dotnet run

# Payment Service
cd services/PaymentService/PaymentService.API
dotnet run

# Notification Service
cd services/NotificationService/NotificationService.API
dotnet run

# Workflow Service
cd services/WorkflowService/WorkflowService.API
dotnet run
```

### API Documentation
Each service exposes Swagger documentation at:
- User Service: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`
- Payment Service: `https://localhost:5002/swagger`
- Notification Service: `https://localhost:5003/swagger`
- Workflow Service: `https://localhost:5004/swagger`

### Health Checks
Health check endpoints available for each service:
- `/health` - Overall health status
- `/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/health/live` - Liveness probe

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: Create new user account with email verification
2. **Login**: Authenticate with email/password to receive JWT token
3. **Authorization**: Include Bearer token in API requests
4. **Role Access**: Different endpoints require different roles
5. **Token Refresh**: Handle token expiration gracefully

## üìä Event-Driven Architecture

### Domain Events
- `DocumentUploadedEvent`: Triggered when documents are uploaded
- `InvoiceCreatedEvent`: Triggered when invoices are generated
- `PaymentProcessedEvent`: Triggered when payments are completed
- `WorkflowCompletedEvent`: Triggered when workflows finish
- `UserRegisteredEvent`: Triggered when users register
- `NotificationSentEvent`: Triggered when notifications are sent

### Event Flow
1. Service publishes domain event to Service Bus
2. Event Bus Consumer routes events to appropriate handlers
3. Handlers process events and trigger additional actions
4. Cross-service communication maintains data consistency

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### API Security
- JWT Bearer authentication on all endpoints
- Role-based authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting protection
- CORS policy configuration

### Data Security
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure password hashing
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection headers
- CSRF protection

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collected
- HTTP request/response metrics
- Database query performance
- Payment processing metrics
- Notification delivery rates
- Workflow execution times
- Error rates and exceptions

### Health Monitoring
- Database connectivity
- Service Bus connectivity
- Storage account accessibility
- Memory usage monitoring
- Application responsiveness

## üîÑ Next Steps (Part 4)

Part 4 will focus on:
1. **Docker Containerization**: Complete Docker setup for all services
2. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Production-ready K8s manifests
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
4. **API Gateway**: NGINX or Azure API Gateway configuration
5. **Load Testing**: Performance testing and optimization
6. **Production Deployment**: Azure deployment with monitoring
