- **PaymentService**: Payment gateway integration and reconciliation
- **WorkflowService**: Dynamic approval workflows and task orchestration
- **AIService**: Document classification and intelligent recommendations
- **UserService**: User management and authentication
- **NotificationService**: Multi-channel notifications and alerts
- **ReportingService**: Analytics dashboards and reporting

### Frontend (Angular 16+)
- Modern SPA with feature-based modules
- Material Design components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Infrastructure
- **API Gateway**: Ocelot-based routing and load balancing
- **Containerization**: Docker for all services
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests
- **IaC**: Terraform configurations
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines
